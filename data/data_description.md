## Context

**Municipal Court**:

- Municipal court is the place where lower-level crimes are adjudicated in the City of Philadelphia. Cases that involve only misdemeanor charges are adjudicated entirely in Municipal court, and then the defendant has the option to appeal the decision to the Court of Common Pleas. Cases that involve felonies start in Municipal Court, where the judge makes an initial determination of whether the Commonwealth has shown probable cause that the defendant committed the crimes. If so, the charges are "held for court" and then move on to the Court of Common Pleas.

**Court of Common Pleas**:

- The Court of Common Pleas is the primary trial court in each county in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia. Criminal cases that involve felonies are adjudicated in the court of common pleas, in addition to appeals from municipal court trials.

**Court Docket**:

- A court docket contains information about a single criminal case that was initiated with a single charging document and usually relates to a single incident, even if it involves multiple criminal charges. It includes a list of hearings and filings in the case and shows the outcome and sentence for each charge.

**Court Summary**:

- A court summary summarizes the criminal record of a particular defendant. It shows the charges and outcome, where applicable, for each of that defendant's cases. Cases that were in Municipal court and then hold for court and transferred to Common Pleas Court will show twice, once for each court. The Court Summary also includes some demographic information about the defendant.

**Crime classifications**:

- In order of most serious to least serious, Pennsylvania crime classifications include:
    * Murder
    * Felony (1st Degree) (F1)
    * Felony (2nd Degree) (F2)
    * Felony (3rd Degree) (F3)
    * Ungraded Felony (F3)
    * Misdemeanor (1st Degree) (M1)
    * Misdemeanor (2nd Degree) (M2)
    * Misdemeanor (3rd Degree) (M3)
    * Ungraded Misdemeanor (M3)
    * Summary Offenses

- The mandatory minimum and maximum penalties for a criminal conviction depend on the classification of crime. Each criminal classification includes sentencing guidelines, which the court considers in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender. This includes considering the Offense Gravity Score, Prior Record Score, and any enhancements, and aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

# Data

# Terminology

### docket

- **Merged**: In criminal law, if a defendant commits a single act that simultaneously fulfills the definition of two separate offenses, merger will occur. This means that the lesser of the two offenses will drop out, and the defendant will only be charged with the greater offense
- **Probation**: the release of an offender from detention, subject to a period of good behavior under supervision
- **Confinement**: confinement to a jail, prison or other penal institution or correctional facility

If a judge sets cash bail, the defendant can be released from detention in county jail when someone posts that amount on the defendant’s behalf. The person posting bail is known as the “surety.” In some cases, the judge may allow the defendant to post only 5% or 10% of the total bail amount."
